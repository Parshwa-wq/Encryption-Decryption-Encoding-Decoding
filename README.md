# Encryption, Decryption, Encoding & Decoding Project

## Overview

This project contains implementations for various encryption and encoding techniques commonly used in data security. The main purpose of this repository is to demonstrate how different algorithms can be applied to both **encode** and **encrypt** data, as well as **decode** and **decrypt** it back to its original form.

The repository includes:
- **Encryption Algorithms**: Caesar Cipher, ROT13, Vigenère Cipher, XOR Encryption
- **Encoding Schemes**: Base64, UUEncoding
- **Decryption and Decoding**: Reverse operations for each algorithm

## Features

- **Caesar Cipher**: A basic encryption method that shifts the letters of the alphabet by a specified number.
- **ROT13**: A simple cipher that shifts the alphabet by 13 positions (commonly used for obfuscation).
- **Vigenère Cipher**: A more complex cipher that uses a keyword to shift letters.
- **XOR Cipher**: A symmetric cipher that uses the XOR bitwise operation.
- **Base64 Encoding/Decoding**: Converts binary data into ASCII characters using a 64-character set.
- **UUEncoding/Decoding**: A text-based encoding format used to represent binary data in ASCII characters.
